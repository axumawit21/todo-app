# Vue.js Todo App

A simple and responsive **Todo Application** built with **Vue 3** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
The app allows users to **add**, **view**, **edit**, **mark as completed**, and **delete** tasks.  
All tasks are stored locally in the browser using **localStorage**, so your data persists even after refreshing.

- **Add New Tasks** – with title, description, deadline, and category.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed** – instantly updates the UI.
- **View Task Details** – including title, description, deadline, category, and created date.
- **Persistent Storage** – data is saved in `localStorage`.
- **Responsive Design** – works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Dynamic Welcome Page** – greeting and navigation to the app.
